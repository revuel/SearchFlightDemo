# Flight search

## Problem

Your goal is to implement a simple flight search.

**Given**

* airport of origin
* airport of destination
* date of departure
* number of passengers

**When** you perform the search

**Then** you get the list of:

* flight code matching the route
* total flight price (for all passengers)

## Implementation considerations

We ask you to solve it using the **Java** programming language. You are only allowed to use test libraries (JUnit, TestNG, Hamcrest, ...) and nothing else.
The project skeleton is already provided, with Maven and Gradle configured as build tools.

Flight routes and base prices are given in the CSV format. You can find them in `src/main/resources` directory. A rudimentary CSV client for reading the data (`com.lastminute.CsvFiles`) with simple tests is provided by us. Feel free to use or implement your own data access mechanism.

Remember that **automated and self-checking tests** are mandatory. You should provide sufficient evidence that your solution is complete by, at a minimum, indicating that it works correctly against the supplied test data.

Put your complete solution in `github.com` under your account (we are curious about your experiments, pet projects and open-source contributions!) or send it compressed by email if you prefer to keep it private.

Although the assignment is initially simple, remember that **you will extend it during the on-site coding interview** by implementing new features. Keep the code clean and maintainable!

## What we value most?

The goal is to provide us with a full understanding of your coding style and skills. We’ll pay particular attention to:

* readable and well-structured code
* design and domain modeling
* quality of tests

## Business rules and constraints

* Search only for direct flights (no stopovers)
* Assume there is always seat availability
* All flights leave every day
* There is only one currency (€)
* Ticket price is based on the number of days to the flight departure and the base price of the flight:

| days prior to the departure date | % of the base price |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| more than 30 (i.e. >= 31)        | 80%                 |
| 30 - 16                          | 100%                |
| 15 - 3                           | 120%                |
| less that 3 (i.e. <= 2)          | 150%                |

## Examples

* 1 passenger, 31 days to the departure date, flying AMS -> FRA

  flights:

    * TK2372, 157.6 €
    * TK2659, 198.4 €
    * LH5909, 90.4 €

* 3 passengers, 15 days to the departure date, flying LHR -> IST

  flights:

    * TK8891, 900 € (3 * (120% of 250))
    * LH1085, 532.8 € (3 * (120% of 148))

* 2 passengers, 2 days to the departure date, flying BCN -> MAD

  flights:

    * IB2171, 777 € (2 * (150% of 259))
    * LH5496, 879 € (2 * (150% of 293))

* CDG -> FRA

  no flights available
